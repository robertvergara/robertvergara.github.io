  <h2>We need your help to  SAVE A LIFE</h2>

    <div class="col-md-12">
    <p>Robert Vergara is fighting for his life and needs your help.</p>

    <p>Most of you know Robert as the charismatic front desk greeter who opens the club at five o’clock each morning. Anyone who knows Robert has certainly been inspired by his warmth, wit and lively conversation. Robert brightens members’ mornings and has become a friend to many. When he is not working, Robert pursues his passion for the arts as both a visual artist and an art educator for children.</p>


    <h2>Robert was recently diagnosed with Metastasized Papillary Thyroid Cancer at 33 years old.</h2>

    <p>Needless to say, this diagnosis is something none of us were prepared for and has left his family and friends reeling from shock and sadness.</p>

    <p>In his characteristic fashion, Robert is adjusting to this terrifying situation with humor and hope. We are all hopeful that an aggressive treatment plan of surgery and radiation will allow Robert to overcome this devastating disease.</p>

    <p>While Robert fights for his life, he will need to draw strength from his friends and family. We want Robert’s energy to be focused fully on his recovery which means that any support we can give that will alleviate his financial and logistical worries is critical. Any contribution you can make—in either time or money—will be a lifeline to Robert as he undergoes what will, no doubt, be a difficult and costly journey back to health.</p>

    <p>We hope that you will help us build a network of support for Robert and keep him in your thoughts through this difficult time.</p>
